namespace Topten.JsonKit
{
    // Used to decorate fields and properties that should be serialized
    //
    // - [Json] on class or struct causes all public fields and properties to be serialized
    // - [Json] on a public or non-public field or property causes that member to be serialized
    // - [JsonExclude] on a field or property causes that field to be not serialized
    // - A class or struct with no [Json] attribute has all public fields/properties serialized
    // - A class or struct with no [Json] attribute but a [Json] attribute on one or more members only serializes those members
    //
    // Use [Json("keyname")] to explicitly specify the key to be used 
    // [Json] without the keyname will be serialized using the name of the member with the first letter lowercased.
    //
    // [Json(KeepInstance=true)] causes container/subobject types to be serialized into the existing member instance (if not null)
    //
    // You can also use the system supplied DataContract and DataMember attributes.  They'll only be used if there
    // are no JsonKit attributes on the class or it's members. You must specify DataContract on the type and
    // DataMember on any fields/properties that require serialization.  There's no need for exclude attribute.
    // When using DataMember, the name of the field or property is used as is - the first letter is left in upper case
    //
